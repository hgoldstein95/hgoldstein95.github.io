Last week I had the pleasure of being a guest on [TheForkJoin](https://twitch.tv/theforkjoin). I
chatted with Rachit Nigam and Oliver Flatt about my computer science journey, my research,
property-based testing in general.

You can watch the video here:

I'm also uploading a few YouTube Shorts with short clips and follow-ups from the conversation, on
