I'm excited to announce that starting in Fall 2024 I will be working with Leonidas Lampropoulos at
the University of Maryland as a Victor Basili Postdoctoral Fellow.  With Leo's guidance I will
continue to explore themes from my PhD work on property-based testing, leveraging tools from
programming languages and human-computer interaction to improve the state of software testing.

I can't wait to see what great opportunities for collaboration pop up over the next two years, and I
am honored to have been awarded this fellowship.
