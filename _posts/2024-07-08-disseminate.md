I had a lovely conversation with Dr. Jack Waudby on the <i>Disseminate</i> podcast. We talked about
<i>Property-Based Testing in Practice</i> and PBT in general. You can find the episode
[here](https://disseminatepodcast.podcastpage.io/episode/harry-goldstein-property-based-testing-55)
or wherever you listen to podcasts.
