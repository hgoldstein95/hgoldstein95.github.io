              | at Cornell University. My love for learning underpins almost
              | everything I do, and I take every chance I get to learn and
              | grow. I am driven, focused, and goal-oriented, bringing those

          h4 My Skills
          p In my studies, I have learned lanugages like
            strong  Java
            |  and
            strong  C++
            | , as well as competencies like
            strong  Object Oriented Programming
            |  and
            strong  Data Structures
            | . Outside of classes, I have explored many other programming
            | languages and paradigms. I do most of my work in
            strong  Linux
            |  and am comfortable with
            strong  bash scripting
            | . Outside of the realm of programming, I am trained in
            strong  public speaking
            |  and other leadership skills.

          h4 My Values
          p I value
            strong  learning
            |  and
            strong  intelligence
            |  very highly, and I am driven by the pursuit of knowledge.
            | My interest in computers is largely due to the fact that I value
            | strong  order, and I feel that writing code is an exercise in
            | coaxing order out of chaos. In my personal life, my most
            | important value is
            strong  self-worth
            |  as it empowers me to be resilient against adversity and failure.
            | For more about the things I value, check out my

          h4 My Interests
          p Even outside of academics, I enjoy writing code. Over the past
            | year,
            strong  web development
            |  has become very interesting to me, and most of the new
            | technologies that I have explored have been web-based like
            strong  node.js
            |  and
            strong  Sass
            | . Through this exploration, I have become very comfortable with
            strong  Javascript
            | . I also enjoy playing
            strong  video games
            |  with my friends, and
            strong  cooking
            |  for my friends and roommates.
