          h4 My Skills
          p In my studies, I have learned lanugages like
            strong  Java
            |  and 
            strong  C++
            | , as well as competencies like
            strong  Object Oriented Programming
            |  and
            strong  Data Structures.
            |  Outside of classes, I've explored
            strong  Ruby
            |  and 
            strong  Python
            | , as well as other popular and up-and-coming languages. Outside of the realm of programming, I am trained in
            strong  Public Speaking
            |  and other leadership skills.

          h4 My Values
          p I value 
            strong  learning
            |  and 
            strong  intelligence
            |  very highly, and I am driven by the pursuit of knowledge. My interest in computers is largely due to the fact that I value
            strong  order
            | , and I feel that writing code is an exercise in coaxing order out of chaos. In my personal life, my most important value is
            strong  self-worth
            |  as it empowers me to be resilient against adversity and failure.

          h4 My Interests
          p Even outside of academics, I enjoy writing code. Over the past year,
            strong  web development
            |  has become very interesting to me, and most of the new technologies that I have explored have been web-based like
            strong  node.js
            |  and
            strong  Sass
            | . I also enjoy playing 
            strong  video games
            |  with my friends, and
            strong  cooking
            |  for my friends and roommates.
