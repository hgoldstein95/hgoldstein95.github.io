**My love for learning underpins almost everything that I do**, and I take every
chance I can to learn and grow. I am **driven**, **focused**, and
**goal-oriented**, and I bring those values to all of the work that I do.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at
[Broadway Technology](https://www.broadwaytechnology.com/). In August 2019 I
will be starting work towards a PhD in programming languages at the University
of Pennsylvania.
