This website is both my **personal website** and my **blog**. If you are a
potential employer, you can find my resume [here](//harrisongoldste.in/resume)
and my GitHub account [here](//github.com/hgoldstein95). You can also feel free
to read my blog posts.

If you are here specifically for my blog, you might be interested to hear why I
decided to start blogging. I spend a lot of my spare time exploring new and
interesting topics (usually in Computer Science, but occasionally in other
areas). After I've spent time and energy digesting information about a topic, a
logical next step would be to write down what I've learned. I thought a blog
would be a nice way to force myself to organize my thoughts, while
simultaneously creating content that others might find useful.
