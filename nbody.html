			<h3>n-Body Simulation</h3>
				<p>
					The n-body problem is a problem in mathematics that can be modeled as a number of planets in gravitational orbit. When there are two bodies, symbolic integration can determine formulae for their paths and the problem becomes simple.
				</p>
				<p>
					When there are three or more bodies, however, symbolic integration is impossible. Instead, each "step" of each body's motion must be calculated as a combination of the gravitational effects of all bodies around it, as the system becomes chaotic. This calculation can be done in many ways, but one common one is to use numerical integration. Rather than find a single integrated formula, integration to determine position is carried out at each step.
				</p>
				<p>
					The team used the "Classical Runge-Kutta Method" of numerical integration to find the paths of any number of planets in orbit. They developed a graphical user interface using wxPython, allowing a user to set up any initial conditions that they were interested in simulating.
				</p>
				<p>
					The team used vPython to display an interactive 3D graphical representation of the simulation in real time. Simulations could be saved or reloaded at any time, and the team created preset simulations to showcase a number of interesting scenarios.
